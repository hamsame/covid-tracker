# Covid-tracker
This is a website I created which displays coronavirus information about a country a user requests. I used the Covid-19-API from M-Media-Group (https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API). The API base is https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1. 

The covid tracker I made with the API displays the number of confirmed cases, deaths, life expectancy and continent of a given country.
I made an XML request to get this data from the API and I used DOM manipulation to make a table and output the data in the table.

# Using the website
Enter country name to view information on its covid information such as confirmed cases.

# To do
I want to add more to the site such as:
-	output a table that has stats for each continent
-	output top 5 countries that have been impacted the most by covid
-	allow user to request information about a particular city or region

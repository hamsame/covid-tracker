# Covid-tracker
This is a website I created which displays coronavirus information about a country a user requests. I used the Covid-19-API from M-Media-Group (https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API). The API base is https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1. The covid tracker I made with the API displays the number of confirmed cases, deaths, life expectancy and continent of a given country. I used the fetch() method to get this data from the API and I used DOM manipulation to output the data.

# Using the website
Use the correct case when entering a country name like France or Peru (I intend on removing the case sensitivity)

# To do
I want to add more to the site such as:
-	add commas to make the numbers more readable
-	output a table that has stats for each continent
-	output top 5 countries that have been impacted the most by covid
-	allow user to request information about a particular city or region

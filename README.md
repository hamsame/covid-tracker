# Covid-tracker

This is a website I created which displays coronavirus information about a country a user requests. I used the Covid-19-API from M-Media-Group (https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API). The API base is https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1.

The covid tracker I made with the API displays the number of confirmed covid cases, deaths and recoveries.

I made an XML request to get this data from the API and I used DOM manipulation to output the data.

# Using the website
